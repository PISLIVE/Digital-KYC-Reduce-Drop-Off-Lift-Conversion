# Digital-KYC-Reduce-Drop-Off-Lift-Conversion
HDFC Bank launched a new Digital KYC onboarding system intended to simplify customer account opening using online submission of identity and address documents. However, since its rollout, the bank has been facing high rejection rates and significant customer drop-offs across various stages of the KYC process.
